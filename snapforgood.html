          <p>Millennials are the driving changemakers of tomorrow, and they’re increasingly gaining the ability to share in richer ways.

          <h3>Snapchat Stories</h3>
          <p>Snapchat’s Stories provides the perfect space for causes and campaigns. I envisioned the way Snapchat may be able to feature certain charitable causes as it does currently with select events, holidays, and cities. By leveraging tools such as Stories and Filters, this could provide charities the ability to connect with communities and stay true to Snapchat by being a place of discovery.</p>
          <p>Imagine if you were able to view select campaigns within your area or certain causes that speak to you and see what supporters were up to. Viewers could add on to these stories by sending their own snaps and video responses, building onto the campaign.</p>
					<p><em>What if donating and showing your support could be as simple as sending a Snap?</em></p></div>

      <h3 class="title-content">Why Snapchat?</h3>
      <div class="page-content">
        <div class="col2">
          <p>Because of its' ephemeral quality as a messaging service, we worry less about how a photo or video might look, and focus more on sharing in the moment. What we post becomes a more genuine reflection of ourselves. This is relevant, as we don't necessarily support organizations, but we support their causes and beliefs because chances are, it might be something that you believe in too. Snapchat for charities would be able to provide a</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col2">
          <p>sense of transparency and a means of providing day-in-the-life content for audiences to discover.</p>
					<p>By partnering with charities and nonprofit organizations, Snapchat is able to enforce Stories as a place of discovery for users with topics beyond entertainment and news. This is just one step in reimagining our social platforms towards a larger purpose.</p>
